# 1
# Triangle has a base equal to 10 and height equal to 8
# Assign those values to two variables

base = 10
height = 8


# 2
# Calculate the area of the triangle from exercise 1 and print the result to the console

area = base * height * 0.5

# 3
# The second triangle has the same height as the first one, but its base is longer by 4
# Calculate the area of the second triangle using variables from exercise 1

base_2 = base + 4
area_2 = base_2 * height * 0.5

# 4
# Put your name and surname into two variables of type String

name = "John"
surname = "Doe"


# 5
# Print out a greeting to the console in one line using variables from exercise 4
# E.g.: "Hello John Doe!"

greeting = "Hello " + name + " " + surname + "!"

# 6
# One item costs $14,23 and the other $10,50
# Calculate the total and assign it to a variable

total = 14.23 + 10.50
